# Inbox

Drop unstructured notes, screenshots, links, and raw docs here.

Policy:
- Inbox is temporary.
- Inbox is append-only: after an item is processed, do not edit the original artifact.
- Distill inbox content into the proper spec files.
- Do not leave links/references from the main spec pack to inbox artifacts.
- If you cannot place an item, create an entry in `../questions/open_questions.md` and copy the necessary context into it (no links back to inbox).

Processed items (copied into canonical locations):
- `flow_run.schema.json` → `../contracts/flow_run.schema.json`
- `flow_run.example.json` → `../contracts/examples/flow_run.example.json`
- `llm_report_file.schema.json` → `../contracts/llm_report_file.schema.json`
- `orchestration_rules.md` → distilled into `../spec/system_integration.md` and `../spec/implementation_contract.md`
- `adjusting_naming_schemes.md` → distilled into `../spec/system_integration.md`, `../spec/implementation_contract.md`, `../contracts/flow_run.schema.json`, `../contracts/flow_run.md`, and refreshed examples/test vectors
- `gemini_api_man.md` → distilled into `../spec/implementation_contract.md` (structured JSON output notes)
