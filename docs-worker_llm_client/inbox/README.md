# Inbox

Drop unstructured notes, screenshots, links, and raw docs here.

Policy:
- Inbox is temporary.
- Inbox is append-only: after an item is processed, do not edit the original artifact.
- Distill inbox content into the proper spec files.
- Do not leave links/references from the main spec pack to inbox artifacts.
- If you cannot place an item, create an entry in `../questions/open_questions.md` and copy the necessary context into it (no links back to inbox).
