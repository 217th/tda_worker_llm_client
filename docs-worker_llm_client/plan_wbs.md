# Plan / WBS for worker_llm_client

Describe epic-level increments (3–10) with product value and acceptance criteria.

Recommended format: a short table (or headings), per epic.

| Epic | Phase (MVP/post‑MVP/hardening) | What changes | Why it matters | How to accept |
|------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Epic 1 | MVP | ... | ... | ... |

Notes:
- If you need non-local environments (dev/test/prod) beyond local runs, consider a dedicated epic for environment setup + deploy/run process (docker/k8s/serverless, CI/CD, runbooks).
